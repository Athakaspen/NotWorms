This is the source code to a Spring 2022 Game Jam project called Exploding Chickens (and a Few Penguins). I designed and created it from start to finish in one week.

Play it here: https://athakaspen.itch.io/exploding-chickens-and-a-few-penguins

The game features physics-enabled destructible terrain and turn-based multiplayer with multiple gamemodes, weapons, items and more.

As this was a single week, solo project, there are relatively few comments. Sorry.
- Destructible terrain code is mostly contained in Scripts/Terrain.gd
- Turn-based gameplay loop is in Scripts/TurnQueue.gd
- Weapons and associated projectiles are in the Scripts/Weapons/ folder
